"""
This class includes the methods to extract features from image.
The features data must be a vector-shaped for the models we used, and
yet preserve the important properties in the image.
The methods converts 2D image to 1D vector:
    image_to_vector - convert by resizing and then flatten the image.
    image_to_histogram_vector - convert to image histogram.
    fd_hu_moments - convert to 7-dimension vector describing the shapes in the image.
    pca_reduction - usnig Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction.
    cany_edge - convert by finding the image edges and then flatten the image.
